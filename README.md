Welcome to Blackjack! Think you can beat the dealer?

You each begin with drawing 2 cards, but one of the dealer's cards is hidden.

You can choose to hit (h) or stand (s).

You can keep hitting to try reaching 21, but if you go over you lose!

If you stand, the dealer plays and will always hit if under 17.

The player closest to 21 without going over wins! (But the dealer wins all ties...)

You can then say yes (y) to play again or no (n) to exit the game. 

Have fun and good luck!
